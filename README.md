## Note

- As per my conversation with Sabaidea's Front-Lead - [Omid Nikrah](https://github.com/omidnikrah) - I've used a [chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) to bypass CORS issues. Make sure you're using this plugin while running this app, otherwise you won't get any API results.

- The UI & Logic code is assuming you're viewing the page on Mobile.

- If you're reviewing the code, please note that I've compromised many things, e.g. Typings, Styling, etc., simply because It was not a priority in this particular challenge. It's not thoroughly type-safe, and it needs better styling. My main focus was to just get the logic right.
